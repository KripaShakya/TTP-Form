/*
Exercise - Form Edit
• Define a Component that displays a user's first and last name in two div tags on the screen along with an 'edit' button.
• When the user clicks on the 'edit' button, the user's first and last name are displayed in two input fields along with a 'save' and 'cancel' button.
  The 'edit' button, and two div tags should not be visible after the user presses 'edit'!
• The user is then allowed to make any changes they want and either press 'save' or 'cancel'
• If they press 'save' any changes they made are reflected into the two divs
• If they press 'cancel' any changes they made are discarded and the divs go back to what they were before pressing 'edit'
